# Contributing to the Integrity Stack Framework (ISF)

Thank you for your interest in refining the Integrity Stack Framework. The ISF is a conceptual standard, and we value critique over code additions. Your time is best spent challenging the structural validity of the framework.

We ask that all contributions align with the core goal: **Eliminating Algorithmic Debt.**

## 1. How to Critique the Standard (Opening an Issue)

The primary way to contribute is by challenging the core concepts. Please open a **New Issue** for the following:

* **Conceptual Challenges:** Do you disagree with the definition of **Algorithmic Debt**? Does a layer of the ISF feel redundant?
* **Technical Flaws:** Can you find a scenario where the logic in `trust_anchor_calc.py` fails to represent true risk?
* **Failure Cases:** Provide a real-world MLOps failure scenario that the ISF does *not* adequately address.

## 2. Submitting Refinements (Pull Requests)

Please reserve Pull Requests (PRs) for minor fixes, clarifying grammar, or adding simple, illustrative code examples (like the `data-schema.yaml`). **Do not submit proprietary code.**

We aim for brutal, honest, technical, and conceptual debate. Thank you for making this standard better.
